Your Kubernetes master has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of machines by running the following on each node
as root:

  kubeadm join 172.31.24.29:6443 --token 5mf81r.r5c8i5pdzv1w0mdh --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:c6c5914a8de499e899c5b70ecaf3c05cd771cb9aa27adaeaffd2c6a5c6b2e6b1
